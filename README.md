NiftyNet is a [TensorFlow][tf]-based open-source convolutional neural networks (CNN) platform for research in medical image analysis and image-guided therapy.
NiftyNet's modular structure is designed for sharing networks and pre-trained models.
Using this modular structure you can:

* Get started with established pre-trained networks using built-in tools
* Adapt existing networks to your imaging data
* Quickly build new solutions to your own image analysis problems

### Code to support multi-task algorithms/methods developed by Felix Bragman (UCL/KCL)

* Uncertainty estimation and spatially adaptive weighting in multi-task learning
* Multi-input multi-task learning
* Probabilistic multi-task architecture learning 

Demos for specific papers will be hosted elsewhere. TBC..
